Fuel cms comes with default admin users but when you are making a website which has user interactions on frontend it's a little trouble. This module will help you to make common operations like login, register, forgot password and edit profile easier.

The module uses [Ion Auth 2][ionauthurl] (The future of authentication)

##Installation
The installation and source can be found on my [github repo][usermoduleurl]
